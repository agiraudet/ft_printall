# ft_printall
A wip tester for 42 project : ft_printf

need python3 installed to work.
run using ./test.py (use chmod +x test.py if necessary first)

options:

  -d : display details for failed tests

  -r <file> : use your own file describing which tests to perform

  -t <test> : run only one test. (remember to escape quotes, should look something like "\"%d\", 42" )

WIP - rules files need to be redone, for now shamelessly inspired from https://github.com/AntoineBourin/printf-tester
please send questions and observations to agiraude@student.42.fr
